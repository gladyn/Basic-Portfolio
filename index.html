          Hi All! My name is Gladys. Here is a bit about where I am from. I was
          born in the city Torrance, and I have always lived in Los Angeles. My
          first job was a waitress in the city of Bell, at a Mexican restaurant.
          I was only there for a year until I started college. I actually got
          accepted to Cal Poly Pomona which I attended for two years. But life
          happens, and due to that my career path changed. I ended up getting a
          job in the insurance industry at the age of 20. I started off as a
          customer service representative and a year after working there I got
          licensed sell insurance in the state of California. I now have my
          property and casualty license along with my life, health and
          disability license. I have now been in the insurance industry for over
          eight years.

          I recall back when I was eighteen, I use to modify myspace profiles. I
          would do it for my family members. I would add images, scroll bars,
          slideshows, music etc. Later on, I come to find out that it was basic
          coding. I have always been into computers and electronics. I remember
          when the iPhone came out; and later on, I was able to jailbreak them
          and modify them to my liking. Aside from that I like the outdoors,
          specially hiking/sightseeing. One of my favorite sports to play is
          Tennis(Although I don't play as much as I would like to. Another
          activity that I like is going to breweries all-round the city and
          counties. Craft beer is something that I enjoy as a pass time. Now I
          am starting my new chapter in my life which is coding boot camp. This
          course is very challenging, but I am ready for a career change! Wish
          me luck!
